            The world is no longer a sphere, but has become a true flat world.
            Connecting people to people regardless of geographical distance or
            time has become more necessary than ever.
            <br />
            <br />
            The tools for human interaction on which ideas and thoughts are
            created, expressed and shared are gradually developed into Social
            Networks, also known as Social Media. Now it is not only an
            important part of the digital age, a place to exchange and share,
            but social networks are also a huge and endless business market.
            <br />
            <br />
            Social listening entails more than setting up a Google Alert to
            monitor what people are saying about you on social media. It
            involves identifying where these discussions are happening and
            getting involved with those who are having them. It also involves
            responding to their queries, providing them with content when they
            express interest, and assisting them with any issues they may have
            when possible.
            <br />
            <br />
            Business through social networks is increasing, leading to fierce
            competition between businesses, and at the same time causing
            difficulties for investors when it is difficult to identify
            reputable information sources, and do not know what to do. How to
            verify projects social media accounts. From that idea, BitScope -
            Social Listening product was born.
            <br />
            <br />
