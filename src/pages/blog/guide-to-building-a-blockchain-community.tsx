            A loyal community decides that a cryptocurrency project has a 70%
            chance of winning. However, the constant fluctuations of the
            blockchain require developers in the community to constantly change
            to meet the diverse needs of customers. All of this is to answer the
            question: &quot;How to create FOMO psychology for my project?&quot;.

            Welcome to the era of community-led growth, or CLG for short. All
            current blockchain projects agree that their revenue is fueled by
            loyal members in their community. <br /> <br />
            Smart business leaders have come to realize that community can no
            longer be an afterthought. As community consultant Brian Oblinger
            describes it, &quot;Being community-led means that community is the
            engine, not a sidecar, of your business.&quot; <br /> <br />
            If you haven&apos;t already, now is the perfect time to join the
            community-led growth movement, as the positive impact of community
            continues to garner attention. According to the 2022 Community
            Industry Report, 87% of community professionals believe that
            community is vital to their company&apos;s mission, and 82% say that
            they have witnessed a growing interest in community from other
            departments.

        content={
          <>
            Community-driven growth is the process of leveraging the community
            to influence business outcomes, such as increasing customers,
            enhancing engagement, and improving customer retention. And most
            notably, the unique business model of Blockchain projects is tied to
            public token sales, an event determined by the loyal fan base in
            their community.
            <br /> <br /> It’s important to note that CLG is related to
            community growth, but they are not exactly the same. Community
            growth refers to all efforts aimed at building, nurturing, and
            strengthening a community. Successful community growth powers
            community-led growth.
            <br /> <br /> Both approaches depend on data to achieve maximum
            impact. Incorporating intelligence from AI and machine learning
            enables “intelligent community growth,” a strategy that uses data to
            surface valuable insights to maintain a strong community growth
            trajectory beyond what a human can achieve manually. <br /> <br />
            Advanced community-led companies often integrate their business
            tools and internal company data into their community technology
            stack to get a clearer picture of the relationship between community
            growth and community-led growth. <br /> <br />
            Overall, leading community growth is a powerful tool that can help
            businesses achieve their goals while building a strong community.
            One way to do this is by fostering meaningful interactions with your
            community. By providing a comprehensive platform to listen and
            identify emotional touchpoints with your community, BitScope enables
            you to connect with your members on a deeper level. This can help
            you to better understand their needs and preferences, and to tailor
            your services accordingly.

        title="How does community-led growth relate to product-led growth?"
        content={
          <>
            Community-led growth (CLG) is often built upon product-led growth
            (PLG), another popular go-to-market (GTM) strategy that positions a
            company&apos;s product as a critical driver of awareness,
            acquisition, and revenue.
            <br /> <br />
            The primary difference between PLG and CLG is that PLG builds from
            the solution, while CLG builds from the user. Here are some key ways
            this difference manifests:

      <TitleAndContent
        title="Audience vs. community"
        content={
          <>
            In PLG, people who decide to try the product make up an audience of
            users who can be marketed or sold to as prospective customers of a
            paid solution. While this audience is important, they have little
            opportunity to contribute to a larger conversation around your
            product (unless there is a community).
            <br /> <br />
            In CLG, people are encouraged to join a community where they are
            welcomed as members whose presence, expertise, and contributions add
            shared value to all users, which in turn brings benefits to the
            business.

      <TitleAndContent
        title="User feedback"
        content={
          <>
            With a PLG-only model, audiences will leave feedback across a
            variety of channels like social media, software review sites, and
            more. However, the responsibility of gathering and synthesizing this
            information may be fragmented across marketing, customer success,
            and/or product teams, which means key insights can get lost in the
            mix and users left feeling unheard.
            <br /> <br />
            When community-led growth supplements PLG, feedback is shared
            organically through conversations among community members. A
            community team using a community-led growth platform can easily
            capture, categorize, and triage this information to identify
            insights that inform stakeholders across the organization, from
            marketing and customer success teams to product, engineering, and
            support teams.

        content={
          <>
            In PLG, specific teams are more heavily involved in different stages
            of the funnel. The marketing team is responsible for attracting
            leads to the free version of the product, which the product team has
            designed to demonstrate value and hook the user. Then the sales team
            often steps in to convert those leads into customers, who will then
            interact with the customer success team, and so on.
            <br /> <br />
            When community-led growth is integrated with PLG, the responsibility
            of attracting leads is more equally distributed across the
            organization. While community managers are often primarily
            responsible for engaging, anyone across the organization can have
            authentic interactions with community members. When cross-functional
            teams engage with the community, members are able to interact with
            the product and business in more meaningful and enduring ways.
            <br /> <br />
            As you can tell, product-led growth and community-led growth are not
            either/or but rather better together. Many of today’s most
            successful B2B companies currently use a PLG + CLG strategy, such as
            Figma, Asana, and dbt Labs. Some of the key ways that CLG can
            enhance PLG initiatives include enabling teams to:

          <>
            A common North Star metric for PLG companies is product qualified
            leads (PQLs), users who have actively engaged with the product,
            demonstrating high intent and signaling they are likely to receive
            value from a sales conversation to convert or upsell.
            <br /> <br />
            Community-led growth companies looking to demonstrate the
            bottom-line impact of community will often measure
            community-attributed revenue (CAR), or revenue that can be tied to
            an organization whose member(s) engaged in the community before they
            appeared in a CRM.

        To enhance your focus, we will temporarily pause the post here. However,
        before closing this post, we want to share with you some ideas for
        developing your CLG community. Firstly, you should optimize your content
        to attract more readers. Secondly, you should increase promotion to
        attract more participants. Finally, you should build a strong personnel
        system to ensure that your community is efficiently managed and
        operated. We will also share with you the measurement indicators so that
        you can evaluate the effectiveness of your CLG community. See you in the
        next post of BitScope.
